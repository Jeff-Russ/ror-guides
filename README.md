# RoR Guides

This is a collection of markdown documents the form the source for Ruby on Rails related content on my personal [webpage](http://www.jeffruss.com/). It's mainly here as a repository for my own editing purposes. The site uses my [markdown.design](https://github.com/Jeff-Russ/markdown.design) as a shell to render markdown documents hosted elsewhere and due to this separation I've made the content be it's own separate repository.  

If you wish to view the guides in the best environment, it's recommended to simply go to the [webpage](http://www.jeffruss.com/). Although cloning this repository might be usefull to you if you want to have the guides available offline where you can mark them up with notes, for example.
