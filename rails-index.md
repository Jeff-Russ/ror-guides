# Learning Ruby & Rails

Learning to use Ruby on Rails requires at least a basic understanding of the Ruby 
language, an understanding of the archetecture and functionalities provided by 
the Rails framework, and some hands-on step-by-step instructions in building a 
and Rails app from beginning to end.  

It's debatable what order you should follow these three tracks since each 
depend on one another. I decided that fusing them all into one big package is 
not the right idea so here I provide each of the three separately:

My recommendation is to bounce around between these three pages. If Ruby syntax 
confuses you, consult the Ruby Cheatsheet, If you feel like you are just apeing 
the steps dictated in the How-To without understanding the what's happening, consult 
the Understanding page, and if you feel the concepts are not sticking without 
actually BUILDING something, hop over to the How-To. 

__NOTE:__ The Ruby Cheatsheet is __NOT__ a complete guide to learning Ruby and, 
especially if you have no prior experience with similar languages like Perl or 
Python you will likely want to bring in a fourth resource! There are so many of 
these; I didn't feel like there was a void to be filled so I didn't bother:
